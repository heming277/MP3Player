#About

This is a command-line version of a MP3 player I coded in C. 

Sounds better than Itunes thanks to mpg123 and libao libraries 

#Features

Easy to use command-line feature
Play all your MP3 files in a directory or just a single file
Can Shuffle or not shuffle the music files

#How to Use
Mac Users can just run the executable since it is statically linked with the libraries
Supply full directory path to your folder or mp3 file

Windows Users may need to install libao and mpg123 or clone my repo to compile and run 

#Built With
mpg123 - Fast console MPEG Audio Player and decoder library
libao - A cross-platform audio output library
C-Language

Authors
